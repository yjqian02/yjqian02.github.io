#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

<!-- ## Bio -->

Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Hong Shen](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/hong-shen) and [Laura Dabbish](https://www.lauradabbish.com/). I collaborated with [Jina Suh](https://www.jinasuh.com/), [Mary L. Gray](https://marylgray.org/), and [Mary Czerwinski](https://ischool.uw.edu/people/faculty/profile/marycz) at Microsoft Research on research focused on identifying and addressing AI harms through red teaming. 

Prior to the start of my Ph.D., I was fortunate to have the opportunity to explore human-centered research across a few different institutions. At the University of Minnesota, I worked with [Stevie Chancellor](https://steviechancellor.com/) on mental health content moderation. At the University of Washington, I collaborated with [Amy X. Zhang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~axz/) to study personalized content moderation. And, at Rutgers University, I worked with [Shagun Jhaver](https://shagunjhaver.com/) examining user perspectives on content moderation.

Broadly, my research interests span the areas of AI safety, AI ethics, red teaming, content moderation, social computing, future of work, and responsible AI. I aim to **build processes and tools to support the human infrastructure within AI development, enabling safer AI systems through practices such as AI red teaming.** I am a recipient of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP). My research has since been supported by the [National Insitute of Standards and Technology (NIST)] (https://www.nist.gov/) and [Microsoft] (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/ai-society-fellows/fellows/)

Outside of my work, I'm passionate about mentorship, encouraging broader participation in computing, and supporting students interested in doing research. I'm always happy to chat about potential collaborations or research üòä. 

<!-- As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into critical systems, there is a growing need for experts capable of identifying and mitigating AI-related harm. This expertise forms the human infrastructure behind responsible AI (RAI), encompassing roles such as annotators, moderators, and AI red teamers. These individuals play a vital role in ensuring that AI systems are ethical and aligned with societal values. 

My research investigates the human infrastructure underpinning the AI development pipeline, using a mixed-methods approach to examine how data work and workplace well-being intersect with RAI efforts. My current projects explore (1) designing methods to support transparency in crowdsourced responsible AI tasks (2) understanding current strategies, tooling systems, and well-being challenges faced by AI red teamers (3) developing a network of practitioners dedicated to support human expertise in AI safety efforts. -->
